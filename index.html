            <h2>Section I – OS, Kernel, Shell</h2>

            <h3>1. What components are part of the von Neuman architecture?</h3>

            <p>The von Neuman architecture consists of the following components:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>a central processing unit containing a control unit and an arithmetic/logic unit</li>
                <li>a memory unit which stores data and instructions</li>
                <li>input and output devices</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This template of components detailed back in 1945 by John von Neumann is what all modern computers are
                based on.</p>

            <h3>2. What is user space?</h3>

            <p>The user space is part of an operating system* and is all the code which runs outside of the operating systems
                kernel**. This could be application software like a web browser or Adobe Photshop, and even different libraries.</p>

                <p class="exp">*Operating system: system software which manages computer hardware, software resources and provides
                    common services for computer programs.</p>
                <p class="exp">**Kernel: a key component of an operating system, and manages communication between the hardware and the
                    user space.</p>

            <h3>3. What is the shell?</h3>

            <h3>4. Where is the shell located?</h3>

            <h3>5. What is the main task of the shell?</h3>
            
            <h2>Section II – UNIX, Scripting</h2>

            <h3>6. What is the octal representation of a file that can be read and written only by its owner?</h3>

            <p>The octal representation of a file which can only be read and written by its owner is 600. If we wanted the
                owner to be able to execute this file as well, for example if the file was a script, we could use the octal representation
                of 700. 
            </p>

            <p>To set this file permission the command <code>chmod 600 (filename)</code> should be used.</p>

            <h3>7. In UNIX systems, what is the common name of the special user that can access and modify every file?</h3>

            <p>The name of the special user that can access and modify every file in a UNIX system is superuser.</p>
            <p>To run a command as the superuser, we use <code>sudo (command)</code>.</p>

            <h3>8. Which file permission classes are available in UNIX systems?</h3>

            <p>There excist three different file permission classes in UNIX systems. These are the user, group and others.
                If we would like to remove or add privileges to any of these classes we use the <code>chmod</code> togheter with 
                a specification of which group(s) we want to change the permissions for, and which permissions to add or remove. 
                The different permissions for a file are read, write and execute.
            </p>

            <h3>9. As of 2020, which percentage of servers have UNIX-like OS?</h3>

            <p>According to <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/operating_system" target="_blank">w3techs.com</a>
            more than 70% of the operating system of servers are Unix or Unix-like. Their excact number as of 13 November 2020 is 71,8%.
            </p>

            <h3>10. The command ssh will:</h3>

            <p>...start the SSH client program. This program establishes a secure connection to a SSH server on a remote machine.
                The ssh command makes it possible to log into a remote machine, transferring files between the machines and excecute
            commands on the remote machine. <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/command/" target="_blank">(ssh.com)</a></p>
            
            <p></p>All students and emplyees at NTNU have their own dedicated remote server. 
            This server is accessed by using the command <code>ssh studentname@login.stud.ntnu.no</code>.</p> 

            <h3>11. UNIX Command: access your current working directory</h3>
            <p>Use <code>pwd</code> for writing the path to your current working directory. Pwd is a shortage for "print working directory".</p>
            <p>If you set your working directory to the desktop using <code>cd Desktop/</code>, and then use the <code>pwd</code> command,
            the output will be: /Users/UserName/Desktop.</p>

            <h3>12. UNIX Command: rename files (give an example)</h3>

            <p>To rename a file you can use the <code>mv</code> command. This is shortage for "move", so this command is also used
            for moving files or folders.</p>

            <p>Lets say our current working directory is the desktop. The path is /Users/UserName/Desktop. There excist one file
                there named apple.txt, and we would like to rename this one to pear.txt.
            </p>

            <code>ls</code> // lists all files at the current working directory, which is the desktop.
            <p>Output: apple.txt</p>
            <code>mv apple.txt pear.txt</code> // first the command wants the source, followed by the target. mv old-file-name new-file-name
            <p>Output: none. Since the operation was successfull, there is no output and the file apple.txt is now renamed to pear.txt.
                Lets confirm this.
            </p>
            <code>ls</code>
            <p>Output: pear.txt</p>

            <h3>13. UNIX Command: schedule the execution of programs in the future</h3>
            
            <p>To schedule the execution of programs in the future, there is something called cron jobs. A cron job is a sheduled task
                which runs at its given time. <code>Crontab -l</code> makes it possible to see if there are any cron jobs saved. To change the file
                containing the cron jobs you have to use <code>crontab -e</code>.
            </p>
            <p>A cron job needs to specify which time it will be running, and what to execute at that time. For example would 
                <code>* * * * * /backup.sh</code> run the script "backup.sh" every minute. The first asterisk represents minute, the second hour, third day, fourth month and the last one day of the week.
                When we use an asterisk, it means any value. Therefore the given example will run at every single minute as long as the cron job is active. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>14. UNIX Command: Forcefully shutdown the command with process ID 123</h3>

            <p>To shutdown a command, we can use the <code>kill</code> command. The command relies on knowing the PID, process ID, which
            in this case is 123. For stopping this process we can simply use <code>kill 123</code>. If for some reason this does not work,
        using <code>sudo kill 123</code> will gain the necessary rights to kill the process.</p>
            
            <p>If there was a process running which we would like to stop, but the PID is unknown, we would have to use
        the <code>ps</code> command. This lists all the running processes, and shows the PID's.</p>
        
          <h3>15. UNIX Command: access your root user</h3>
            <p>If you need special privileges and full rights, you can access your root user with the command <code>sudo</code>.
            This allows you to run a command as the root user as long as you include "sudo" in front of the commands everytime. If you need to
        run several commands afterwards as the root user, you can use <code>sudo -i</code> to remove the need of including "sudo" everytime.
    If you wonder which user you are currently using it is possible to use the command <code>whoami</code>, and the name of the
active user will be printed.</p>
